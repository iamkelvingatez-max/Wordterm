# WordTerm (Linux)

This folder is for Linux-only notes/scripts. The main Electron app lives in the repo root.

## Dev quickstart
1) Install Node.js LTS + build deps for native modules (node-pty)
2) From repo root:
   - npm install
   - npm run
   - then run the appropriate script shown by npm run

## Linux notes
- Put .desktop launcher notes, permissions, and distro-specific deps here.
